# EduVerse Enhanced Profile System

This module provides a comprehensive and extensible profile management system for EduVerse, supporting intelligent career development and project-based learning.

## üéØ Overview

The enhanced profile system allows users to:

- View and update their complete profile information
- Manage nested sections (Education, Experience, Licenses, Projects) independently
- Upload profile images with proper validation
- Access AI-generated skills (read-only)
- Maintain academic/professional growth tracking

## üèó Architecture

### Models

#### Profile Model

- **Core Fields**: `display_name`, `bio`, `location`, `website`, `profile_image`
- **AI-Managed**: `skills` (read-only, auto-generated)
- **Relationships**: One-to-many with Education, Experience, License, Project
- **Social Features**: Followers, following, blocked users, close friends

#### Nested Models

- **Education**: School, degree, field of study, dates, description
- **Experience**: Title, company, location, dates, current status, description
- **License**: Name, organization, dates, credential info
- **Project**: Title, description, dates, URL, research flag

### Serializers

#### ProfileSerializer

- Full profile representation with nested data
- Handles image URLs with fallback logic
- Includes counts and statistics

#### ProfileUpdateSerializer

- Optimized for PATCH operations
- Supports multipart form data for image uploads
- Validates file size and type

#### Nested Serializers

- `EducationSerializer`, `ExperienceSerializer`, `LicenseSerializer`, `ProjectSerializer`
- Proper validation for date ranges and business logic
- Clean field definitions with appropriate read-only fields

## üîê Authentication & Permissions

### Authentication

- All endpoints require JWT authentication
- Include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header

### Permissions

- Users can only access and modify their own profile data
- Public profile viewing is available for other users
- Skills field is read-only (AI-managed)

## üìÅ File Upload

### Profile Images

- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Upload directory: `media/profile_images/`
- Fallback logic: profile_image ‚Üí avatar ‚Üí default

### Validation

```python
# File size validation
if value.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024:
    raise ValidationError("Profile image file size must be under 5MB")

# File type validation
allowed_types = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png', 'image/gif']
if value.content_type not in allowed_types:
    raise ValidationError("Only JPEG, PNG, and GIF images are allowed")
```

## üß† AI Integration

### Skills Management

- Skills are automatically generated by AI based on user activities
- Users cannot manually add or remove skills
- Skills are returned as read-only data in profile responses
- Format: `{"skill_name": "proficiency_level"}`

### Future Enhancements

- AI-powered skill recommendations
- Automatic skill extraction from projects and experiences
- Skill gap analysis and learning recommendations

## ‚úÖ Validation Rules

### Education

- End date cannot be before start date
- All fields are optional except school_name

### Experience

- End date cannot be before start date
- Current positions should not have end dates
- All fields are optional except title and company

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration

#### React Example

```javascript
// Get user profile
const getProfile = async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/profiles/me/", {
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Update profile with image
const updateProfile = async (data, imageFile) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  Object.keys(data).forEach((key) => {
    formData.append(key, data[key]);
  });
  if (imageFile) {
    formData.append("profile_image", imageFile);
  }

  const response = await fetch("/api/profiles/me/", {
    method: "PATCH",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
    },
    body: formData,
  });
  return response.json();
};

// Add education entry
const addEducation = async (educationData) => {
  const response = await fetch("/api/profiles/me/education/", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(educationData),
  });
  return response.json();
};
```

#### Python Example

```python
import requests

# Get user profile
def get_profile(token):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    response = requests.get('https://api.eduverse.com/api/profiles/me/', headers=headers)
    return response.json()

# Update profile with image
def update_profile(token, data, image_path=None):
    headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}

    if image_path:
        with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
            files = {'profile_image': f}
            data = {**data, 'profile_image': f}
            response = requests.patch(
                'https://api.eduverse.com/api/profiles/me/',
                headers=headers,
                data=data,
                files=files
            )
    else:
        response = requests.patch(
            'https://api.eduverse.com/api/profiles/me/',
            headers=headers,
            json=data
        )

    return response.json()
```

## üîß Configuration

### Settings

```python
# Media files configuration
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'

# Avatar upload settings
AVATAR_MAX_SIZE = 5 * 1024 * 1024  # 5MB
AVATAR_ALLOWED_FILE_TYPES = ['image/jpeg', 'image/jpg', 'image/png']
```

### URL Configuration

```python
# Include in main urls.py
urlpatterns = [
    path('api/', include('profiles.urls')),
]
```

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Use `select_related` and `prefetch_related` for nested data
- Index frequently queried fields
- Consider caching for public profile data

### File Handling

- Implement image resizing for large uploads
- Use CDN for serving media files in production
- Implement proper cleanup for deleted images

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- Advanced privacy controls
- Profile analytics and insights
- Integration with external platforms (LinkedIn, GitHub)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced search and filtering

### API Extensions

- Bulk operations for nested sections
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Webhook support for profile changes
- GraphQL endpoint for complex queries
