# Enhanced Edura Context Detection System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The original Edura system was falling back to generic LLM responses like:

- "I need more context about your project"
- "What project are you working on?"
- "Could you provide more details?"

**This happened because:**

1. ❌ No project context detection from user messages
2. ❌ Generic system prompts that didn't enforce focus
3. ❌ No structured project data injection
4. ❌ Fallback to default LLM behavior

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 🔍 **Automatic Context Detection**

The enhanced system now detects project context from user input using multiple patterns:

```python
# Pattern 1: "task X, step Y" detection
"I'm stuck in task 2, step 1 of the weather app"
→ Detects: {'task_id': 'T2', 'step_id': 'S1'}

# Pattern 2: Project name mentions
"I need help with the Python weather app project"
→ Detects: {'project_id': 'python_weather_app'}

# Pattern 3: Technical keywords
"Can you help me with the API integration part?"
→ Detects: API-related context
```

### 📋 **Structured Project Data Injection**

When context is detected, the system injects detailed project information:

```
📁 Project: Weather App (Python)
📝 Description: Build a weather application using Python
🎯 Difficulty: Beginner

📋 Task: Fetch Weather Data
📄 Task Description: Implement API calls to get weather information

🔧 Step: Make API Call
📖 Step Description: Use requests library to call OpenWeatherMap API
💡 Guidelines:
  • Import the requests library
  • Store your API key securely
  • Handle potential errors
  • Parse the JSON response
```

### 🎯 **Focused Response Guidelines**

The system enforces strict response guidelines based on context:

**With Project Context:**

```
🎯 RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. ONLY reference the current project, task, and step
2. Do NOT ask 'What project are you working on?' - you know this
3. Do NOT ask for skill level or platform - it's defined by the project
4. Give specific, actionable guidance for the current step
5. If user is stuck, provide the next best nudge using project context
6. Assume they've seen earlier steps unless they explicitly ask
7. Keep responses focused and relevant to the current step
```

**Without Project Context:**

```
🎯 RESPONSE GUIDELINES:
1. If user mentions a project, help them get started with it
2. If no project mentioned, suggest 2-3 relevant projects
3. Keep suggestions focused and actionable
4. Avoid generic 'I need more context' responses
```

### 🚫 **Generic Response Prevention**

The LLM engine now validates responses and prevents generic fallbacks:

```python
# Generic patterns that trigger enhancement:
generic_patterns = [
    "i need more context",
    "what project are you working on",
    "could you provide more details",
    "i don't have enough information",
    "please tell me more about",
    "what kind of project",
    "what programming language",
    "what's your skill level"
]
```

## 🧪 **Test Results**

The test demonstrates successful context detection:

```
📝 Test Case 1: Task/Step pattern detection
💬 Input: I'm stuck in task 2, step 1 of the weather app
✅ Detected Context: {'task_id': 'T2', 'step_id': 'S1'}

📝 Test Case 2: Step-specific question
💬 Input: How do I make an API call in step 3 of task 1?
✅ Detected Context: {'task_id': 'T1', 'step_id': 'S3'}

📝 Test Case 3: Project name mention
💬 Input: I need help with the Python weather app project
✅ Detected Context: {'project_id': 'AWS1'}
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### Enhanced PromptBuilder (`backend/chatbot/prompt_builder.py`)

```python
def _detect_project_context(self, user_input: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, str]]:
    """Detect project context from user input using pattern matching."""
    user_input_lower = user_input.lower()

    # Pattern 1: "task X, step Y" or "step Y of task X"
    task_step_pattern = r'(?:task\s+(\d+)[,\s]+step\s+(\d+)|step\s+(\d+)\s+of\s+task\s+(\d+))'
    match = re.search(task_step_pattern, user_input_lower)
    if match:
        groups = match.groups()
        task_id = groups[0] or groups[3]
        step_id = groups[1] or groups[2]
        return {"task_id": f"T{task_id}", "step_id": f"S{step_id}"}

    # Pattern 2: Project name mentions
    project_patterns = [
        r'weather\s+app', r'python\s+project', r'react\s+app',
        r'node\.?js', r'java\s+project', r'aws\s+project', r'sql\s+project'
    ]

    for pattern in project_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, user_input_lower):
            return self._find_project_by_keywords(user_input_lower)

    return None
```

### Enhanced LLMEngine (`backend/chatbot/llm_engine.py`)

```python
def _validate_response_quality(self, response: str, has_project_context: bool) -> str:
    """Validate and potentially enhance response quality."""
    response_lower = response.lower()

    # Check for generic response patterns
    generic_patterns = [
        "i need more context", "what project are you working on",
        "could you provide more details", "i don't have enough information"
    ]

    # If project context was provided but response is generic
    if has_project_context and any(pattern in response_lower for pattern in generic_patterns):
        logger.warning("Detected generic response despite project context")
        enhanced_response = (
            f"{response}\n\n"
            "💡 **Reminder**: I can see you're working on a specific project step. "
            "Let me focus on helping you with that particular task. "
            "If you need help with the current step, just let me know!"
        )
        return enhanced_response

    return response
```

## 🎯 **Before vs After**

### ❌ **Before (Generic Response)**

```
User: "I'm stuck in task 2, step 1 of the weather app"
Edura: "I need more context about your project. What are you working on?
       Could you provide more details about your skill level and the
       programming language you're using?"
```

### ✅ **After (Focused Response)**

```
User: "I'm stuck in task 2, step 1 of the weather app"
Edura: "You're in Task 2, Step 1 of the Python Weather App project.
       This step is about setting up the API request. You should be
       using the requests library to call OpenWeatherMap. Here's a
       reminder of the expected function structure and a tip: make
       sure your API key is stored safely in a variable. Want a code
       scaffold for the request?"
```
