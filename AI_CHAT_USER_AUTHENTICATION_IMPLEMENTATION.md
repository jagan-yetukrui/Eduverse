# AI Chat User Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of user-specific chat functionality for the Edura AI chatbot, ensuring that each user has their own private conversations and messages.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: All users shared the same hardcoded `user_id = "test-user-id"`, meaning:

- All conversations were stored under a single dummy user
- Every user saw the same chat history
- No privacy or user isolation

**After**: Each authenticated user has their own private chat experience:

- Conversations are scoped to individual users
- Users can only access their own conversations
- Proper JWT authentication and security

## Implementation Details

### 1. Frontend Changes (`frontend/src/Notes/Notes.js`)

#### Authentication Integration

- **Added**: `useUser` hook import for user context
- **Added**: `useNavigate` for login redirection
- **Replaced**: Hardcoded `user_id = "test-user-id"` with `user?.id || user?.user_id`
- **Added**: Authentication check and login redirect

#### API Call Updates

- **Added**: JWT token headers to all API calls
- **Removed**: `user_id` parameter from request bodies (now handled by backend)
- **Updated**: All fetch calls to include `Authorization: Bearer ${token}` headers

#### Key Changes:

```javascript
// Before
const user_id = "test-user-id";

// After
const { user, isLoading: userLoading } = useUser();
const user_id = user?.id || user?.user_id;

// Authentication check
useEffect(() => {
  if (!userLoading && !user) {
    navigate("/login");
  }
}, [user, userLoading, navigate]);
```

### 2. Backend Changes (`backend/ai/views.py`)

#### Authentication Framework

- **Added**: Django REST Framework decorators (`@api_view`, `@permission_classes`)
- **Added**: JWT authentication requirement (`@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])`)
- **Replaced**: Manual user_id extraction with `request.user.id`

#### Security Enhancements

- **Added**: User ownership verification for all conversation operations
- **Added**: Conversation access control (users can only access their own conversations)
- **Added**: Proper error handling for unauthorized access

#### Key Changes:

```python
# Before
@csrf_exempt
@require_http_methods(["GET"])
def list_conversations(request):
    user_id = request.GET.get('user_id')

# After
@api_view(['GET'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def list_conversations(request):
    user_id = str(request.user.id)
```

#### New Security Pattern:

```python
# Verify conversation ownership
conversations = conversation_manager.list_conversations(user_id)
if not any(conv['conversation_id'] == conversation_id for conv in conversations):
    return Response({
        'status': 'error',
        'message': 'Conversation not found or access denied'
    }, status=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)
```

### 3. API Endpoint Updates

#### Updated Endpoints:

- `GET /api/ai/list_conversations/` - Now uses JWT auth
- `POST /api/ai/start_conversation/` - Now uses JWT auth
- `POST /api/ai/send_message/` - Now uses JWT auth
- `GET /api/ai/get_messages/` - Now uses JWT auth
- `POST /api/ai/rename_conversation/` - Now uses JWT auth
- `DELETE /api/ai/delete_conversation/` - Now uses JWT auth

#### New Endpoint:

- `GET /api/ai/health/` - Health check (no auth required)

### 4. URL Configuration (`backend/ai/urls.py`)

Updated to use the new health check function instead of lambda.

## Security Features

### 1. JWT Authentication

- All chat endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- Tokens are automatically validated by Django REST Framework
- Invalid tokens return 401 Unauthorized

### 2. User Isolation

- Users can only access their own conversations
- Conversation ownership is verified before any operation
- Attempts to access other users' conversations are blocked

### 3. Input Validation

- All required fields are validated
- Conversation IDs are verified against user ownership
- Proper error messages for security violations

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. Start backend: `python3 manage.py runserver`
2. Start frontend: `npm start`
3. Login to the application
4. Navigate to Notes page
5. Create conversations and verify they're user-specific

### Automated Testing

Run the test script: `python3 test_ai_auth.py`

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data

- The conversations directory was empty, so no migration was needed
- If there were existing conversations, they would need to be migrated to user-specific storage

### Backward Compatibility

- The old hardcoded user approach is completely replaced
- No backward compatibility maintained (by design for security)

## Benefits

### 1. Privacy

- Each user's conversations are completely isolated
- No risk of data leakage between users

### 2. Security

- Proper authentication required for all operations
- Users cannot access other users' conversations
- JWT tokens provide secure session management

### 3. Scalability

- User-specific storage allows for better resource management
- Conversations can be easily backed up per user
- Future features like conversation sharing can be implemented securely

### 4. User Experience

- Users see only their own chat history
- Conversations persist across sessions
- Clean, personalized interface

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:

1. **Conversation Sharing**: Allow users to share conversations with specific users
2. **Conversation Export**: Export conversations to various formats
3. **Conversation Categories**: Organize conversations by topics or projects
4. **Bulk Operations**: Delete multiple conversations at once
5. **Conversation Search**: Search through conversation history

### Technical Improvements:

1. **Database Storage**: Move from file-based to database storage for better performance
2. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed conversations
3. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket support for real-time chat updates
4. **File Attachments**: Support for sharing files in conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **401 Unauthorized Errors**

   - Check if user is logged in
   - Verify JWT token is valid and not expired
   - Ensure token is being sent in Authorization header

2. **Conversations Not Loading**

   - Verify backend is running
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Ensure user authentication is working

3. **Permission Denied Errors**
   - Verify conversation belongs to the authenticated user
   - Check if conversation ID is valid

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser network tab for API calls
2. Verify JWT token in localStorage
3. Check backend logs for authentication errors
4. Use the test script to verify API endpoints

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully transforms the AI chat feature from a shared global system to a secure, user-specific experience. Each user now has their own private conversations with proper authentication and authorization controls, ensuring data privacy and security while maintaining a seamless user experience.
